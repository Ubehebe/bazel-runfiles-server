    bazel running a `serve()` target starts a web server on an open port serving the given
    `data` files. If `index` is specified, it also opens the system's default web browser to that
    file.

    When ibazel running a `serve()` target, any changes to the `data` or `index` files are
    immediately displayed in the browser.

    This is neither a rule implementation function nor a macro. It is a helper function to be called

    browser can call this function to set up all the serving logic. Requirements:

    - The rule must declare `executable = True`, but cannot already produce an executable. (This
       function writes to ctx.outputs.executable.)
    - The rule must mix `SERVE_ATTRS` into its own attributes: `attrs = dict(SERVE_ATTRS, **{...})`.
